# Financial_Analysis
Using financial data to understand, predict and profit from stocks

The goal of this project is to use data to improve my ability to pick good stocks.
The repository now contains a Jupyter Notebook called "Part 1 Financial Analysis."
In this file, I use the yfinance package, data analytics and time series modelling to determine whether Microsoft is a good stock to buy and when to best do it.
This established a set of analyses I need to do for other stocks and identifies current bottlenecks in the strategy.

**Technologies used:**
Python
Machine Learning
Time Series Analysis
Financial Domain knowledge
